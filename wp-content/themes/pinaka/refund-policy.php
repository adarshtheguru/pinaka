			<p>At Pinaka, we strive to deliver exceptional service and high-quality results for all of our clients. To ensure optimal project execution and resource allocation, we maintain a clear policy regarding refunds. Once a project commences, including the initial investment and resource allocation, refunds are not available. However, we are committed to open communication throughout the project lifecycle. We will gladly discuss any concerns you may have and work collaboratively to ensure your complete satisfaction with the final outcome.</p>
